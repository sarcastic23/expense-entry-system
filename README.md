# expense-entry-system
This is my first proper project,, it is my first so its not that perfect ...
THIS program works on a simple expense entry type work. Json is used to store the data provided in the program because its just a miniproject.
<br>
also the project is not completely begineer oriented as there is a concept of data being stored for future use as well. 
i didnt felt the need to use objects as ,, adding expenses , checking balance , and doing other tasks doesnt require any objs.
